            <li>1kg potatoes</li>
            <li>6 medium sized eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>1-2 onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Potatoes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly (about 1/8 inch thick). You can also cut them into small cubes if you prefer.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Cook the Potatoes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced potatoes (and onions, if using) to the skillet. Season with a pinch of salt.</li>
                    <li>Cook the potatoes slowly, stirring occasionally, until they are tender but not browned (about 15-20 minutes). Drain any excess oil if needed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <li>Beat the Eggs:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, crack the eggs and beat them until well mixed. Season with a little salt.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Combine Potatoes and Eggs:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, gently fold them into the beaten eggs, ensuring they’re well coated.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cook the Tortilla:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wipe out the skillet and add a bit of fresh olive oil. Heat it over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Pour the potato and egg mixture into the skillet, spreading it evenly.</li>
                    <li>Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the bottom is set and golden brown.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Flip the Tortilla:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To flip the tortilla, place a large plate over the skillet. Carefully invert the tortilla onto the plate, then slide it back into the skillet to cook the other side.</li>
                    <li>Cook for another 5-7 minutes until it’s cooked through and golden on both sides.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Serve:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once done, transfer the tortilla to a plate. You can serve it hot, warm, or at room temperature, cut into wedges or slices.</li>
